            <p>“Each person comes into this world with a specific destiny--he has something to fulfill, some message
                has to
                be delivered, some work has to be completed. You are not here accidentally--you are here
                meaningfully.
                There
                is a purpose behind you. The whole intends to do something through you.”<br>

            Osho, born on <i>11 December 1930</i> in Kuchwada, India, began his spiritual journey in
            the 1960s
            after
            experiencing a profound spiritual awakening. He later gained recognition as Acharya Rajneesh and
            eventually as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. <br>

            Central to Osho's teachings was the concept of meditation as a means to achieve self-realization and
            spiritual growth. He developed numerous meditation techniques, including dynamic meditation,
            Kundalini meditation, and the "OSHO Active Meditations," which combine physical movement, breathing,
            and mindfulness to help practitioners achieve a state of awareness.

            Osho's philosophy emphasized living life to the fullest, embracing joy and celebration, while also
            advocating for a deeper understanding of oneself through introspection and meditation.

            One of the most controversial aspects of Osho's teachings was his unconventional approach to
            sexuality and relationships. He challenged societal norms and advocated for the freedom of
            expression in all aspects of life.


            In the 1970s and 1980s, Osho attracted thousands of followers from around the world to his ashram in
            Pune, India, where he delivered discourses, conducted meditation sessions, and engaged in dialogue
            with his disciples. However, his commune faced legal and social challenges, including conflicts with
            the Indian government and local authorities.

            In 1981, Osho relocated to the United States and established a new commune, Rajneeshpuram,
            Oregon. The commune's expansion and confrontations with the local community and government
            authorities led to legal troubles, including Osho's arrest and subsequent deportation from the
            United States and entering his name in the Interpol database under the
            label <b>‘Danger to National Security’</b>.

            Despite the controversies surrounding him, Osho's teachings continue to influence millions of
            people
            worldwide. His emphasis on
            individual freedom, mindfulness, and spiritual exploration remains relevant to many seekers on
            the
            path of self-discovery. Osho passed away on <i>January 19, 1990</i>. When his doctor inquires
            whether they
            should
            prepare
            for cardiac resuscitation, Osho says, <i><b>"No, just let me go. Existence decides its
                    timing."</b></i>
            leaving
            behind a legacy that
            continues
            to inspire spiritual seekers around the world.
